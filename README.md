# shortstack - a link shortening service to minify stacks of links!
As someone who shares a lot of links in discord and clutters up chats, I felt like making a quick and easy little link shortener. It's VERY barebones, but at the very least users are able to add links to a "stack"
and share that stack with the world.

I also thought it'd be very funny to make it have a pancake theme because pancakes are served in stacks or some shit.
